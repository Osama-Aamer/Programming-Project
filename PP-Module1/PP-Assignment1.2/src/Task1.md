# Orientation Tasks 2 – Task 1 (Writing)

## a) Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event?

As customer arrivals are recurring, when a customer arrives (ex: at time 5), we must schedule the next arrival (ex: at time 10).
This ensures the simulation continues to generate customers at the correct intervals (ex: every 5 minutes for type X).
Without self-scheduling, only one customer would ever arrive before simulation stops.

## b) Which event should be generated by the start of the service (of a single service point)?

The service completion event (a B-event), when a customer starts service at time t, we schedule a B-event (bound event) to occur at t + serviceTime.
