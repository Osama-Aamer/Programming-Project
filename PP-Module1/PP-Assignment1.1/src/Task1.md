Situation:
Traffic Flow at Intersection
Why Simulation is Better?
Cannot stop real traffic for testing, Simulation allows testing 100s of scenarios safely.
Sustainability Aspect:
Optimizes signal timing which leads to a reduce fuel waste, thus leading to less CO₂ emissions

Situation:
Hospital Emergency Room
Why Simulation is Better?
As we cannot pause real patients. Simulation models patient flow, wait times, staffing.
Sustainability Aspect:
Reduce patient wait time → better resource use, less energy waste

Situation:
Supermarket Checkout
Why Simulation is Better?
Real experiments disrupt customers. Simulation tests queue policies.
Sustainability Aspect:
Reduce idle time → lower electricity, staff has more energy.



Benefits of simulation:
Safe: No risk to people/property
Repeatable: Run 1000 times with same/different parameters
Cost-effective: No need to build physical systems
Scalable: Test extreme cases (e.g., 1000 customers at once)
